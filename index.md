### Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 3 Part 1 

    Lab 3, part 1 was a favorite because it was the first ever program I got to work on in the class. I was able to write a program using functions for the first time. I learned how to use functions and their return values. 

* Lab 7 

    Lab 7 was a favorite because it had a real life application to it. I was able to implement many conditional statements to determine if certain parking times are allowable. I learned how to think logically when there are multiple conditions. 

* Lab 10 

    Lab 10 was a favorite because it was the first lab where I was able to figure it out with minimal help. I learned how to use 2D vectors for the first time. It got a little complicated at first, but I ultimately figured it out.
